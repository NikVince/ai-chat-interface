## Evaluation Criteria (Grade Breakdown)

| Criteria | Explanation | Weight |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Problem Solving Techniques** | Clear scope, comprehensible project, appropriate technologies, understandable architectural choices, functionality | **10%** |
| **Methodology/Ideas/Procedure** | Development and architectural decisions, recognizable design and technology decisions, meaningful choices | **20%** |
| **Quality of Implementation** | Visible software development concepts, clean code, consistent documentation, compliance with acceptance criteria | **40%** |
| **Creativity/Correctness** | Originality of solution approach, solution fulfills intended objective, correctness verified by testing | **20%** |
| **Formal Requirements** | Submission follows acceptance criteria, respects formal submission requirements | **10%** |

## Critical Success Factors

### What "Functioning Application" Means:
- **NOT UI mockups or design flows** - must be working code
- **Must actually run** in a web browser
- **Must demonstrate real functionality** - not just visual appearance
- **Backend must actually communicate** with frontend
- **Dynamic aspects must be genuinely interactive**

### Required Documentation Standards:
- **Code Comments**: Every function and complex logic section
- **Architecture Documentation**: Explain technical decisions and design choices
- **Installation Instructions**: Clear enough for another developer to run the application
- **README.md**: Professional repository documentation

### GitHub Repository Requirements:
- **Public Repository**: Must be accessible for evaluation
- **Organized Structure**: Clear separation of frontend/backend code
- **Complete Dependencies**: All necessary files for deployment
- **Installation Guide**: Step-by-step setup instructions
- **Professional Presentation**: Repository should look professional and complete

## Assignment Context & Constraints

### Academic Integrity Requirements:
- Original work demonstrating student's understanding
- External libraries and resources must be properly attributed
- Code must demonstrate learning objectives achievement

### Practical Constraints:
- **Time Limit**: Must be achievable within course timeline
- **Scope Management**: Avoid feature creep, focus on core requirements
- **Evaluation Independence**: Must work without external dependencies for evaluation
- **Technology Flexibility**: Wide choice of technologies, but must justify decisions

### Learning Objectives Demonstrated:
- Modern web development practices
- Frontend-backend integration patterns
- Responsive design implementation
- Security considerations in web applications
- Professional documentation and project organization
- Version control and repository management

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Technical Red Flags:
- Non-functioning application (UI mockups only)
- Missing responsive design
- No real frontend-backend communication
- Poor or missing code documentation
- Incomplete installation instructions

### Academic Red Flags:
- Late submission or missing components
- Failure to follow formal submission requirements
- Inadequate demonstration of learning objectives
- Poor presentation quality or missing demo video

### Professional Red Flags:
- Unprofessional GitHub repository organization
- Missing or poor quality documentation
- Code without comments or structure
- Security vulnerabilities (especially API key exposure)

## Current Development Phase Status

**Phase 1**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Concept document submitted  
**Phase 2**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS - Development & Presentation  
**Phase 3**: ‚è≥ PENDING - Finalization & Submission  

### Immediate Phase 2 Goals:
1. **Build functioning application** meeting all technical requirements
2. **Create professional GitHub repository** with complete documentation
3. **Prepare 10-slide presentation** with embedded demo video
4. **Document all architectural decisions** and code implementation
5. **Ensure evaluation readiness** - application must work for tutors without setup complexity
